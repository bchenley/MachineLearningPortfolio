# Brandon Henley's Machine Learning Portfolio

Hello! I'm Brandon Henley, a biomedical engineer with a background in physiological system modeling and signal processing. I'm currently embarking on a career transition to bridge my research skills into practical industry applications, especially in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This repository showcases some of the projects I've undertaken during this transition phase.

## Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

### Diabetes: Blood Glucose Level Forecasting
Predicting blood glucose levels is crucial for diabetic patients in planning their meal and insulin doses. The application of a CNN-LSTM model to this problem showcases the convergence of biomedical data with advanced machine learning techniques for practical healthcare implications. I use continuous blood glucose level, insulin doses, and dietary intake data to develop a CNN-LSTM model in PyTorch that forecasts 90 minutes of blood glucose levels, achieving an RMSE of 24.8 mg/dl.
